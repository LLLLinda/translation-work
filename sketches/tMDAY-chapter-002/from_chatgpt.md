Is there some kind of drawing lots? And I happened to draw it?	难道有什么抽签形式，我正好抽到了？
I was extremely depressed and never stepped into the "Ascension to the Coffin Inn" again.	我万分郁闷，从此不再踏入“升棺酒楼”。
I can never go back to the 21st century of that time and space.	我再也不可能回到那个时空的二十一世纪了。
I mean, besides having a higher status than a dead soul, what other benefits are there?	我是说除了比死魂地位更崇高以外的其它好处。
Until this moment, I truly realized that I am no longer in the human world.	直到此刻，我才真正意识到，自己已不在人世。
I want to go back, even just to have a glimpse of how she's doing.	我想回去，就是远远看一眼也好，看她过的如何。
"Great!" Brother Ghost Head jumped up, forgetting all his worries.	“太好了！”鬼头大哥跳了起来，高兴得忘乎所以。
It seems that it is only to reduce the workload of the ghost officer, isn't that the assistant of the ghost officer?	敢情只是为了减轻鬼吏的工作量，那不就是鬼吏的助手嘛。
So, I foolishly asked Brother Ghost Head, "After the term of the ghost messenger expires, what will he be promoted to?	于是，我傻傻地问鬼头大哥，“鬼差任期满以后，升作什么？
In the underworld, there will be no dead souls. The dead souls are all waiting in the Wandering City to be judged or reborn.	在地府，是不会有死魂的，死魂都在枉死城里等着判罪或投胎。
Brother Ghost Head's gaze at me was very creepy, almost as if he was very satisfied with me.	鬼头大哥看我的眼神非常让我毛骨悚然，简直是对我很满意。
I muttered, and my mother's description of her haggard face appeared in my mind. Is she okay?	我愣愣地低语，母亲那形容憔悴的脸浮现在我脑中，她还好吗？
Three dead souls who were recruited by Brother Ghost Head a few days ago joined me.	和我一起加入的，有三个死魂，是鬼头大哥前几日招揽进来的。


Chinese	English
和我一起加入的，有三个死魂，是鬼头大哥前几日招揽进来的。	Three dead souls joined me, they were recruited by Brother Gui Tou a few days ago.
死魂是不会出汗的，我觉得如果能出汗的话，我应该在冒冷汗了。	Dead souls don't sweat, but I feel like I would be sweating if I could.
这时就需要鬼差，把人类的死魂定住，他们才能慢条斯理地收魂啊。	This is when a ghost catcher is needed to restrain the human souls so that they can be collected at a leisurely pace.
鬼差，照鬼头大哥的说法，就是地府中的百姓，也是最平凡的一种官职。	According to Brother Gui Tou, a ghost catcher is a common official in the underworld, similar to an ordinary citizen.
而在鬼头大哥看来，显然，从死魂到鬼差，绝对是麻雀变凤凰，一个质的飞越。	To Brother Gui Tou, the transition from a dead soul to a ghost catcher is a qualitative leap, like a sparrow transforming into a phoenix.
而鬼差，相当于九品芝麻官手下干杂务的差役，换言之，官已经小到不能再小了。	Ghost catchers are equivalent to low-ranking officials who perform menial tasks, like a sesame official under the ninth rank. In other words, they are as low-ranking as officials can be.
法术的修炼并没有我原本想象的那么艰涩，基本可以总结为五个字：心静自然成。	Learning magic isn't as difficult as I thought it would be. It can be summed up in five words: "calm mind, natural mastery."
“当然！”鬼头大哥欣慰地拍拍我的肩膀，“你可是我千挑万选的，我等你很久了。	"Of course!" Brother Gui Tou pats my shoulder with satisfaction. "I chose you carefully, and I've been waiting for you for a long time."
不像练武功，不需要内力，却似佛法，练就心平气和，靠无欲无求地打坐，精进法术。	Unlike martial arts, magic doesn't require internal energy. It's more like Buddhism, where you cultivate a calm mind and meditate without desire or attachment to improve your magic.
“首先，不管是牛头马面还是黑白无常都是人间传说，其实不过就是鬼吏。”	"First of all, whether it's Ox-Head and Horse-Face or Black and White Impermanence, they're just human legends. In

Chinese	English
他摆摆手，“首先，不管是牛头马面还是黑白无常都是人间传说，其实不过就是鬼吏。	He waved his hand and said, "First of all, whether it's Ox-Head and Horse-Face or Black and White Impermanence, they are all human legends, in fact they are just ghost officials."
我回想了一下，鬼差好像是运送魂魄的吧，但真实情况是怎样，估计也只有到了地府才清楚。	I thought back and remembered that ghost messengers seemed to be responsible for transporting souls, but the true situation was probably only clear when one reached the underworld.
我面前突然出现一张合约，他一把抓起我右手大拇指，往合约右下角一摁，一个红色指印浮现纸上。	Suddenly, a contract appeared in front of me. He grabbed my right thumb and pressed it onto the lower right corner of the contract, leaving a red fingerprint on the paper.
鬼差的培训课程历时三个月，其中不包括一个月的实习期，培训地点在黄泉大道321号的府邸中。	The ghost messenger training program lasted for three months, not including a one-month internship period. The training location was in the mansion at 321 Hades Boulevard.
直到第三个月，我才恍然明白，鬼头大哥那时绝对是忽悠我来着的，我根本不可能再见到我的母亲。	It wasn't until the third month that I suddenly realized that the boss of the ghosts had definitely tricked me into coming. I could not see my mother again.
原以为不过是换了个方式，继续在人间晃悠，但是燕掠水面，不可能无痕，我已经真正成为过去式了。	I thought it was just a change of method and that I could continue to wander around in the human world, but like a swallow skimming over the water, it leaves no trace. I had truly become a thing of the past.

Chinese	English
我茫然地抬头看鬼头大哥，发现他变得异常年轻异常高大，这种超乎寻常的兴奋让我有种被骗的不详预感。	I looked up at Ghost Head and saw that he became unusually young and tall. This extraordinary excitement gave me a feeling of being deceived.
“虽然他说了很多关于鬼差的地位，在死魂中是多么多么的无以伦比，但我还是不太清楚，鬼差是干什么的。	"Although he talked a lot about the status of the ghost catcher, how incomparable it is among the dead souls, I still don't quite understand what the ghost catcher does.
“地府最不缺的，就是死魂了，你不做，自有其它死魂可以做，你可以选择去投胎，但是，你真的不想做吗？	"The underworld is not short of dead souls. If you don't do it, other dead souls can do it. You can choose to be reborn, but do you really not want to do it?
其次，世上死魂那么多，鬼吏怎么抓得过来，尤其是人类的死魂，一不小心，飘远了，很难追回来，还会为祸活人。	"Secondly, there are so many dead souls in the world. How can the ghost officials catch them all, especially the dead souls of humans? If they accidentally float away, it is difficult to retrieve them, and they can also cause harm to the living."
”对于工作内容，他却只有轻描淡写的一句，“在鬼吏到来之前，要把死魂定在尸体上，省的飘出去乱晃，扰乱人间。	"As for the job content, he only said in a casual manner, "Before the ghost official arrives, the dead soul must be fixed on the body to prevent it from floating around and causing chaos in the human world."
鬼头和鬼差一样是种职务，职务内容和现代的猎头比较相像，就是从千万死魂中，选择有潜质的人担当地府相应的职务。	"Ghost Head and Ghost Catcher are both positions. The job content is similar to that of modern headhunters, which is to select people with potential from millions of dead souls to assume the corresponding position in the underworld."
说起这，必须要交代一下，鬼头大哥原名姓吴，别人都叫他“吴鬼头”，因为我没有其它相熟的鬼头，所以还是叫他鬼头大哥。	"Speaking of this, it must be explained that Ghost Head's real name is Wu. Others call him 'Wu

... record for serving a full term."

"Live a peaceful life, working for the same company, in the same position, doing the same thing, without any transfers, moves, or vacations for ten years. Every day of those ten years was basically the same."

Upon learning this, I was furious and resentful, and even kicked Brother Gui's leg. In the end, Bai Xiaoxiao and I hugged each other and wept bitterly, although we could no longer shed any tears, and she could never see her daughter again, and I could never see my mother again.

The four of us were trained together, and we would occasionally chat and talk during our spare time. The most interesting thing was when Bai Xiaoxiao and I introduced modern advanced life to the other two, shocking them to the point where they thought we were from outer space.

During the first month, we were taught the rules of the underworld, during the second month, we were taught spell cultivation, and during the third month, we were taught how to attach souls to corpses. The courses were taught in a cyclical manner, meaning that new dead souls could join the class at any time, with the class size roughly staying around fifteen people, which was considered small.

Brother Gui was responsible for recruiting new ghost messengers, making him the top recruiter for this position. He was the most capable and successful of all the ghost heads in this regard.

说起这，必须要交代一下，鬼头大哥原名姓吴，别人都叫他“吴鬼头”，因为我没有其它相熟的鬼头，所以还是叫他鬼头大哥。	Speaking of this, I must explain that Brother Gui Tou's original name is Wu, and everyone calls him "Wu Gui Tou". Since I don't know any other Gui Tou, I still call him Brother Gui Tou.
鬼头大哥想了想，眼中闪过类似狡诈的光芒，快得让我以为是错觉，“鬼差可以重返人间，而且和鬼吏不同，一般人能看到他们。	Brother Gui Tou thought for a moment, and a sly gleam flashed in his eyes so quickly that I thought it was an illusion. "Gui Chai can return to the human world, and unlike Gui Li, ordinary people can see them."
他愣了好半晌，似乎是从没考虑过这个问题，“不清楚，从没人做满过，久而久之，大家也不关心这个了，估计前任鬼头也不知道。	He was stunned for a while, as if he had never considered this question before. "I'm not sure. No one has ever completed a full term, and over time, no one cares about it anymore. I guess the former Gui Tou didn't know either.
教导的是位高级鬼头，姓张，他说这也需要天分，并着重强调了吴鬼头是他教过的最没有天分的一号人物，因为他浮躁，贪欲过甚，狡诈成性。	The one who taught us was a senior Gui Tou surnamed Zhang. He said that this also requires talent, and emphasized that Wu Gui Tou was the least talented person he had ever taught, because he was impetuous, greedy, and cunning.
没理会我的诡异眼神，他继续道，“因为，鬼差任期一百年，但是已经很久很久，应该说是从没有人，能做满一百年，我期待你可以破这个记录。	Ignoring my strange gaze, he continued, "Because the term of Gui Chai is one hundred years, but it has been a very, very long time since anyone has been able to complete a full term. I hope you can break this record.
“安分守己地过日子，十年都在一家厂，一个工作岗位，做着同一件事情，没有调动，没有搬家，没有休假，十年中的每一天，基本上都重复得一模一样。	"Living a quiet and simple life, working at the same factory, in the same job, without any transfer, moving, or vacation, every day for ten

English Translation:
"Living a peaceful life, I worked for the same factory and in the same position for ten years. There was no transfer, no moving, and no vacation. Every day for ten years was almost exactly the same.
When I found out about this, I was angry and resentful. I even kicked Brother Gui's head. Finally, White Xiaoxiao and I hugged each other and cried bitterly. Although we could no longer shed tears, she would never see her daughter again, and I would never see my mother again.
The four of us were trained together. We would chat and talk to each other from time to time. The most interesting thing was that White Xiaoxiao and I would introduce modern advanced life to the other two, which shocked them and made them feel that we were from outer space.
In the first month, we were taught the rules of the underworld, the second month was about practicing magic, and the third month was about paying attention to soul fixation. The courses were repeated, and newly recruited souls could join at any time. The number of students was roughly kept at fifteen, which was considered a small class.
Brother Gui was responsible for recruiting ghost officials. He was considered the lowest level of this position, and his term was thirty years. It is said that after thirty years, he can recruit higher-ranking officials, such as ghost officials, ghost servants, long counts, judges, and so on, which can be considered as a promotion.
Because the "soul fixation notice" stated that although ghost officials have a certain range of selection in several parallel time and space, it is strictly forbidden for them to go to the space and time one hundred years before or after their death, in order to prevent them from using their position for personal gain and violating the laws of fate.
Among the other three dead souls, the first was called Bai Xiaoxiao, who was from Hubei and died at the age of thirty-seven due to illness. She had a cheerful personality and was frustrated by her illness when she was alive. Now she is curious about everything and wants to try being a ghost official before considering reincarnation. The second was Tang Qi, a soldier from the Eight Banners in the previous century. He died young on the battlefield of the Opium War. Fortunately, he did not kill anyone before he died, otherwise he would have been arrested and executed unjustly. He never became an official and was tricked into becoming a ghost official by Brother Gui's "ghost officials are also officials" talk. The third was Zhu Jun, an elderly man who died in the Qing Dynasty at the age of eighty. He claimed that he was tired of living and had enough of it. He wanted to rest for a few years as a ghost official before being reincarnated."

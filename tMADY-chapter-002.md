By taking on the translation of TMADY, I was able to get a feel for how to assimilate Chinese colloquialisms into English.

The series will soon be submitted on NovelUpdate.com, and if you'd like, you can also find the first chapter translated by Mikan, whose work I intended to follow through.

Chapter 002: Induction Training


According to Brother Gui Tou, a messenger is a common official in the underworld, similar to an ordinary citizen.

In the underworld, there will be no dead souls. The dead souls are all waiting in the City of Innocent Deaths to be judged or reborn. Those in the underworld are all officials. Messenger are equivalent to low-ranking officials who perform menial tasks, like a sesame official under the ninth rank. In other words, they are as low-ranking as officials can be.

To Brother Gui Tou, the transition from a dead soul to a messenger is a qualitative leap, like a sparrow transforming into a phoenix.

"What does the messenger do for work?" Although he talked a lot about the status of the messenger, how incomparable it is among the dead souls, I still don't quite understand what the messenger does.

"The job of a ghost messenger is very easy, just to set the souls. As for the job content, he only said in a casual manner, "Before the ghost official arrives, the dead soul must be fixed on the body to prevent it from floating around and causing chaos in the human world."

"I thought collecting souls was the job of Ox-Head and Horse-Face." I thought back and remembered that ghost messengers seemed to be responsible for transporting souls, but the true situation was probably only clear when one reached the underworld.

“Not a whit. ”He waved his hand and said, "First of all, whether it's Ox-Head and Horse-Face or Black and White Impermanence, they are all human legends, in fact they are just ghost officials. Secondly, there are so many dead souls in the world. How can the ghost officials catch them all, especially the dead souls of humans? If they accidentally float away, it is difficult to retrieve them, and they can also cause harm to the living."

It seems that it is only to reduce the workload of the ghost officer, isn't that the assistant of the ghost officer? "Why was I selected? "Is there some kind of drawing lots? And I happened to draw it?

"You were chosen for being steadfast and knowing your place. "Brother Brother Gui Tou's gaze at me was very creepy, almost as if he was very satisfied with me.

"steadfast and knowing my place? "What does it mean?

"Living a quiet and simple life, worked for the same factory and in the same position for ten years. There was no transfer, no moving, and no vacation. Every day for ten years was almost exactly the same.

Sounds like a life of—complete misery. "Is this an advantage?"

"Absolutely! "Brother Gui Tou pats my shoulder with satisfaction. "I chose you carefully, and I've been waiting for you for a long time."

My hair stood on end. Are you waiting for me to die? "Why?"

Ignoring my strange gaze, he continued, "Because the term of messenger is one hundred years, but it has been a very, very long time since anyone has been able to complete a full term. I hope you can break this record."

"No one has ever completed it?"

"No, the turnover rate is 100%. "He admitted sadly.

Dead souls don't sweat, but I feel like I would be sweating if I could. "Can I not do it?"

"You can. "He said these two words through gritted teeth. 	"The underworld is not short of dead souls. If you don't do it, other dead souls can do it. You can choose to be reborn, but do you really not want to do it?"

"What are the benefits of doing it? I mean, besides having a higher status than a dead soul, what other benefits are there?"

Brother Gui Tou thought for a moment, and a sly gleam flashed in his eyes so quickly that I thought it was an illusion. "Messenger can return to the human world, and unlike Ghost Officials, ordinary people can see them."

Can return to the human world?

I muttered, and my mother's haggard face appeared in my mind. Is she okay? "Can I walk in the human world?"

"You can." He thrusted his fist into his chest and promise.

"Can ordinary people see me?"

"Of course."

"Okay, I promise you, I'll be a ghost messenger."

I want to go back, even just to have a glimpse of how she's doing. Because she is the only relative I cannot let go of in this world.

"Great!" Brother Brother Gui Tou jumped up, forgetting all his worries.

Suddenly, a contract appeared in front of me. He grabbed my right thumb and pressed it onto the lower right corner of the contract, leaving a red fingerprint on the paper. "It's settled then."

I looked up at Brother Gui Tou and saw that he became unusually young and tall. This extraordinary excitement gave me a feeling of being deceived.

The ghost messenger training program lasted for three months, not including a one-month internship period. The training location was in the mansion at 321 Hades Boulevard. During the first month, we were taught the rules of the underworld, during the second month, we were taught spell cultivation, and during the third month, we were taught how to attach souls to corpses. The courses were taught in a cyclical manner, meaning that new dead souls could join the class at any time, with the class size roughly staying around fifteen people, which was considered small.

Three dead souls who were recruited by Brother Gui Tou a few days ago joined me.

Speaking of this, I must explain that Brother Gui Tou's original name is Wu, and everyone calls him "Wu Gui Tou". Since I don't know any other Gui Tou, I still call him Brother Gui Tou.

Brother Gui was responsible for recruiting ghost officials. He was considered the lowest level of this position, and his term was thirty years. It is said that after thirty years, he can recruit higher-ranking officials, such as ghost officials, ghost servants, long counts, judges, and so on, which can be considered as a promotion.

So, I foolishly asked Brother Gui Tou, "After the term of the ghost messenger expires, what will he be promoted to?

He was stunned for a while, as if he had never considered this question before. "I'm not sure. No one has ever completed a full term, and over time, no one cares about it anymore. I guess the former Gui Tou didn't know either.

I was extremely depressed and never stepped into the "Ascension to the Coffin Inn" again.

Among the other three dead souls, the first was called Bai Xiaoxiao, who was from Hubei and died at the age of thirty-seven due to illness. She had a cheerful personality and was frustrated by her illness when she was alive. Now she is curious about everything and wants to try being a ghost messenger before considering reincarnation. The second was Tang Qi, a soldier from the Eight Banners in the previous century. He died young on the battlefield of the Opium War. Fortunately, he did not kill anyone before he died, otherwise he would have been arrested and executed in the city of Innocent Deaths. He never became an official and was tricked into becoming a ghost messenger by Brother Gui Tou's "ghost officials are also officials" talk. The third was Zhu Jun, an elderly man who died in the Qing Dynasty at the age of eighty. He claimed that he was tired of living and had enough of it. He wanted to rest for a few years as a ghost messenger before being reincarnated."

The four of us were trained together, and we would occasionally chat and talk during our spare time. The most interesting thing was when Bai Xiaoxiao and I introduced modern advanced life to the other two, shocking them to the point where they thought we were from outer space.

Learning magic isn't as difficult as I thought it would be. It can be summed up in four words: "calm mind, grow mastery. "Unlike martial arts, magic doesn't require internal energy. It's more like Buddhism, where you cultivate a calm mind and meditate without desire or attachment to improve your magic. The one who taught us was a senior Gui Tou surnamed Zhang. He said that this also requires talent, and emphasized that Wu Gui Tou was the least talented person he had ever taught, because he was impetuous, greedy, and cunning. I felt a sense of sorrow about this by heart.

It wasn't until the third month that I suddenly realized that the boss of the ghosts had definitely tricked me into this job. I could not see my mother again. Because the "soul fixation notice" stated that although ghost officials have a certain range of selection in several parallel time and space, it is strictly forbidden for them to go to the space and time one hundred years before or after their death, in order to prevent them from using their position for personal gain and violating the laws of fate.

I can never go back to the 21st century of that time and space.

Upon learning this, I was furious and resentful, and even kicked Brother Gui Tou's leg. In the end, Bai Xiaoxiao and I hugged each other and wept bitterly, although we could no longer shed any tears, and she could never see her daughter again, and I could never see my mother again.

Until this moment, I truly realized that I am no longer in the human world. I thought it was just a change of method and that I could continue to wander around in the human world, but like a swallow skimming over the water, it leaves no trace. I had truly become a thing of the past.
